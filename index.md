My name is Jayashree Balaraman. I am a rising senior at East Brunswick High School.My passion revolves in STEM and I want to pursue a medical career in the future. I am a certified Bharathanatyam dancer; I have danced for 12 years of my life and have completed my Aragetram (my dance graduation). During the pandemic, I also gave back to the society by 3D printing units of PPE as part of an organization called united3D. I love volunteering and giving back to the society in various ways including through Key Club. That's a little bit about me!
